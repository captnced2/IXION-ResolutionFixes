# Resolution Fixes
[Nexusmods]()  
<br>
This mod fixes some bug/issues with IXION resolutions.  
Currently fixes two things:
- Resolution doesn't reset anymore after restart
- UI is now positioned at the border of the screen for ultrawide resolutions (2560x1080 & 3440x1440)

The resolution sometimes still resets but I don't know when that happens so its difficult for me to fix.  

Thanks to Quetsle (@quetsle on Discord) for the idea for this mod.
